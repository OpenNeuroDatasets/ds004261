Abstract: 

The misinformation effect occurs when people’s memory of an event is altered by subsequent inaccurate information. No study has systematically tested theories about the dynamics of human hippocampal representations during the three stages of misinformation-induced false memory. This study replicates behavioral results of the misinformation effect, and investigates the cross-stage pattern similarity in the hippocampus and cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results show item-speciﬁc hippocampal pattern similarity between original-event and post-event stages. During the memory test stage, hippocampal representations of original information are weakened for true memory, whereas hippocampal representations of misinformation compete with original information to create false memory. When false memory occurs, this conﬂict is resolved by the lateral prefrontal cortex. Individuals’ memory traces of post-event information in the hippocampus predict false memory, whereas original information in the lateral parietal cortex predicts true memory. These ﬁndings support the multiple-trace model, and emphasize the reconstructive nature of human memory.
